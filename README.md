# front_page_website_exercise

Just an exercise. Practically creating a front page while only having an image as reference.
06.10.22 - The front page is mostly done and will be kept as such for now.

Things that need fixing/modified:
- Make images and text respond and adjust accordingly when browser is manipulated.
- Some padding and margins may be not ideal.
- Extra CSS code that might be redundant or unnecesary.
